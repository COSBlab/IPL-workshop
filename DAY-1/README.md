# IPL-workshop: Day 1

## P1: Identify homolog structures wth BLAST

**Aim**

In this exercise, we will use [Protein BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastp&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome) to look in the PDB database for systems with high sequence identity to the target and possibly in complex with antibodies and receptors.

**Tasks**

To complete this exercise, the student needs to:
* paste the target sequence into the box "Enter Query Sequence"
* select the "Protein Data Bank" as database
* run the search
* analyse results table: system type, sequence identity, coverage, structure resolution

## P2: Sequence alignment with MAFFT

**Aim**

**Tasks**

To complete this exercise, the student needs to:
