# IPL-workshop: Day 4

## <a name="group"></a>Group activity

**Aim**

In this group activity, the students will use all the modelling techniques learned during the first 3 days to identify the most likely immunogenic domains of the HEV capsid protein.

**Tasks**

To complete this exercise,

* students will be organized in group of 4/5 people

* the sequence of the HEV capsid protein will be communicated during the workshop

* students are free to try all the techniques learned during the workshop to obtain a consensus preditiction of the immunogenic domains of the HEV capsid protein
